# Lab7
JUnit tests were edited, deleted, and rewritten to no avail.
As shown in web-cat, JUnit tests were breaking my compilation, though i could not figure out why.
Web-cat showed my import statements after the line of code where I created the class for the JUnit test.
In my code, i saw the import statements above the code (as is normal).

I will bring in photos to Thursday's class meeting to help solve this issue and avoid problems in the future.
